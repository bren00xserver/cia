        <h1>Amazon Alexa might be working with the CIA</h1>

      "The video starts off innocently enough. The woman recording it asks whether Alexa would ever lie to her. Alexa notes that while she might occasionally get things wrong, she would “never intentionally lie to you or anyone else.” She also has no problems defining what the CIA is when asked. But then the woman in the video asks the simple question: “Alexa, are you connected to the CIA?” Rather than respond one way or the other, Alexa simply shuts down entirely." - avclub.com

      "A new video shows a woman asking an Amazon Echo a slew of questions about the Central Intelligence Agency, which it answers. But what happens when she asks it, “Alexa, are you connected to the CIA?”

Radio silence." - heavy.com

            <pre>UPDATE: Amazon reached out to TechnoBuffalo with the following statement: 

This was a technical glitch which we have fixed. Alexa’s response to this question is:

Are you connected to the CIA?

No, I work for Amazon.

So there you go, just a “glitch” no conspiracy, right? Right. 

"Things start to get interesting, however, when the woman quizzes Alexa on whether it’s “connected to the CIA.” The question is presented to the assistant twice, and on both occasions it fails to deliver a response, sending conspiracy theorists nuts." - technobuffalo.com
